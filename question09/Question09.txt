Solution for Problem 01:
    "bq" to start the utility
    "rel ABC" to specify the relation
    "di" to display the data structure after specifying the relation
    and then, "x" to exit

Solution for Problem 02:
    "bq" to start the utility
    "rel XYZ" to specify the relation
    "re f" to read the first record in the relation
    "re l" to read the last record in the relation
    and then, "x" to exit

Solution for Problem 03:
    "bq" to start the utility
    "rel XYZ" to specify the relation
    "key key<10>" to specify the key to read
    then, "re k" to read the record associated with the key value identified
    then, "re n" and "re n" twice to read the next record two times ahead
    and then, "x" to exit
