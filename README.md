Question 03
-----------
Question three is a question that asks for an algorithm that prints the counter value from one to a hundred. If the value is divisible by 3, then prints Foo instead of the value. If the iteration is divisible by 5, then prints Baa. If the iteration is divisible by 3 and 5 simultaneously, it prints FooBaa. And if the number is not divisible by 3 and 5, print the iteration number itself. Furthermore, this code must have the minimum amount of code lines and should be efficient.
